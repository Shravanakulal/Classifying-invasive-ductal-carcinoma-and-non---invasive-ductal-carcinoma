Classifying invasive ductal carcinoma and non - invasive ductal carcinoma
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in India and accounts for 7% of
the global burden of breast cancer and one-fifth of all cancers among women in India.
Over 90,000 new cancer cases are estimated to occur this year and over 50,000 women
are estimated to die of it annually in India. Multiple data mining, machine learning and
deep-learning techniques were developed and applied for classification of breast cancer
cells.

Despite significant improvements in medicine, pathological image analysis remains the
most common method for diagnosing breast cancer. Histopathologic evaluation of tissue
sections, performed by pathologists, is indispensable for the diagnosis and treatment of
breast cancer. Evaluation of these slides by human reviewers requires considerable
training and expertise, is subject to error, and is time-consuming. Furthermore, visual
reviews are limited to known morphology patterns, which do not fully take advantage of
the actionable information embedded within histopathologic images.

Therefore, here we are combining digital histopathology images and machine learning
algorithms to classify invasive and non-invasive breast cancer. The main aim of our
project is to classify invasive and non-invasive breast cancer using machine learning

algorithms. A brief description of breast carcinomas before we dive deep into algorithms-
Breast carcinomas are often divided into 2 main types:

1. Invasive carcinoma.
2. Non-Invasive carcinoma.
